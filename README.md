## Description

`fnord` is a command line tool that uses multiple LLM-powered agents and tools to provide a conversational interface to your codebase, notes, and other (non-binary) files.

It can be used to generate on-demand tutorials, playbooks, and documentation for your project, as well as to search for examples, explanations, and solutions to problems in your codebase.

## Why `fnord`?

AI-powered tools are limited by to the data built into their training data. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** using tool calls can supplement the training data with information, such as your code base, to provide more accurate and relevant answers to your questions.

But even with RAG, the AI still runs up against the **context window**. This is the conversational "memory" of the AI, often making use of an "attention mechanism" to keep it focused on the current instructions, but causing it to lose track of details earlier in the conversation.

If you've ever pasted multiple files into ChatGPT or worked with it iteratively on a piece of coce, you've probably seen this in action. It may forget constraints you defined earlier in the conversation or hallucinate entities and functions that don't exist in any of the files you've shown it.

`fnord` attempts to mitigate this will cleverly designed tool calls that allow the LLM to ask _other_ agents to perform tasks on its behalf. For example, it can generate a prompt to ask another agent to read through a file and retrieve specific details it needs, like a single function definition, the declaration of an interface, or whether a specific functions behaves in a certain way. This keeps the entire file out of the "coordinating" agent's context window while still allowing it to use the information in the file to generate a response. This allows `fnord` to conduct more complex research across many files and directories without losing track of the details it needs to provide accurate answers.


## Features

- Semantic search
- On-demand explanations, documentation, and tutorials
- Git archaeology
- Learns about your project(s) over time
- Improves its research capabilities with each interaction


## Installation

Fnord is written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and is distributed as an `escript`.

- **Install [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)**
```bash
# MacOS
brew install elixir

# Debian-based
sudo apt-get install elixir
```

- **Add the `escript` path to your shell's PATH**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.mix/escripts:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- **Install `fnord`**
```bash
mix escript.install github sysread/fnord
```

- **Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell environment**

Set this in your shell environment to the OpenAI project key you wish to use for this tool.
You can create a new project and get a key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).


- **Optional: Install a markdown viewer**

Markdown seems to be the language of choice for LLMs, so installing something like `glow` to pipe output to will make the output more readable.


## Getting Started

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume that `fnord` is installed and we are using it to interact with your project, `blarg`, which is located at `$HOME/dev/blarg`.


### Index your project

The first step is to index your project to make it searchable with `fnord`'s semantic search capabilities.
The first time you index your project may take a while, especially if there are a lot of files.
`fnord` respects `.gitignore`, but you may also wish to exclude certain paths or globs from indexing (e.g., `-x 'node_modules'`).

```bash
fnord index --project blarg --dir $HOME/dev/blarg --exclude 'node_modules'
```

If you cancel partway-through (for example, with `Ctrl-C`), you can resume indexing by running the same command again.

You must re-index your project to reflect changes in the code base, new files, deleted files, or to change the directory or exclusions. This is done by running the same command again.

`fnord` stores its index in `$HOME/.fnord/$project`.


### Search your code base

`fnord`'s semantic search is powered by embeddings generated by OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model. The indexing process does a lot more than simply generated embeddigs for the contents of your files. It also generates summary documentation for each file as well as an index of all functions, entities, and symbols in each file to enhance semantic matches for common questions and symbols.

```bash
fnord search --project blarg --query "callers of some_function"
fnord search --project blarg --query "some_function definition"
fnord search --project blarg --query "unit tests for some_function"
```

The summaries generated by the indexing process can also be included in the search results with the `--detail` flag.

```bash
fnord search --project blarg --query "some_function declaration" --detail | glow
```

If you would like to see more information about a single file, you can use the `summary` command.

```bash
fnord summary --project blarg --file "path/to/some_module.ext" | glow
```


### Generate answers on-demand

`fnord` uses a combination of LLM-powered agents and tool calls to research your question within your project, including access to semantic search and git tools (read only!).

As it conducts its investigation, you will see some of the research steps reported back to you in real-time. These are printed to `STDERR` so they will not interfere with redirected output. If you wish to see more of this, set `LOGGER_LEVEL=debug` in your shell.

```bash
fnord ask --project blarg --question "Where is the unit test for some_function?"
fnord ask --project blarg --question "Find all callers of some_function"
fnord ask --project blarg --question "Is there a function or method that does X?"
fnord ask --project blarg --question "How do I add a new X implementation?"
```

Conversations (the transcript of messages between the LLM and the application) are saved for future reference and continuation. After each response, you will see a message like:
```
Conversation saved with ID: c81928aa-6ab2-4346-9b2a-0edce6a639f0
```

#### Continuing a conversation

If desired, you can use that ID to continue the conversation with `--follow`.

```bash
fnord ask --project blarg --follow c81928aa-6ab2-4346-9b2a-0edce6a639f0 --question "Is some_function still used?"
```

List conversations with the `conversations` command. Adding `--file` will point to the file where the conversation is saved. `--question` will include the question that prompted the conversation.

```bash
fnord conversations --project blarg --question --file
```

#### Replaying a conversation

You can also `replay` a conversation, replicating the output of the original question, research steps, and response.

```bash
fnord replay --project blarg --conversation c81928aa-6ab2-4346-9b2a-0edce6a639f0 | glow
```

As it learns more about your project, `fnord` will be able to answer more complex questions with less research.


### Learning over time

`fnord` learns about your project over time by saving facts and inferences it makes about the project while researching your questions. These facts and inferences are saved and made
searchable in the project's data in the `$HOME/.fnord` directory.

You can view the facts learned thus far, organized by topic, with the `notes` command.

```bash
fnord notes --project blarg | glow
```

Over time, these can become quite extensive, redundant, and stale over time as your code base evolves.

Consolidate and fact-check the notes for your project with the `defrag` command.

```bash
fnord defrag --project blarg
```

`fnord` knows how to "prime the pump" for its learning process with an initial set of learnings.

```bash
fnord ask --project blarg --question "Prime your research notes and report your findings"
```


### Upgrades

`fnord` is under active development and new features are added regularly. To upgrade to the latest version, simply run:

```bash
fnord upgrade
```

Note that this is just a shortcut for:

```bash
mix escript.install github sysread/fnord
```


### Other commands
- **List projects:** `fnord projects`
- **List files in a project:** `fnord files --project foo`
- **Delete a project:** `fnord torch --project foo`


## Tool usage

All of the tool calls available to `fnord` are available for external use via the `tool` subcommand.

```bash
# List available tools
fnord help tool

# Get help for a specific tool
fnord tool --tool file_search_tool --help

# Call the tool
fnord tool --tool file_search_tool --project blarg --query "some_function definition"
fnord tool --tool file_info_tool --project blarg --file "path/to/some_module.ext" --question "What public functions are defined in this file?"
```
